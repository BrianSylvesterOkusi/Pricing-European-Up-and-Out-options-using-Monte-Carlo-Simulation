# Pricing-European-Up-and-Out-options-using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
The objective of this project is to price Up-and-Out barrier option barrier option using Monte Carlo Simulation. This type of option expires when the underlying stock price touches the barrier level. Otherwise, the option will stay active and give a payoff at the maturity.
# Methods applied
Pricing European Up-and-Out options using Monte Carlo Simulation
# Steps followed
1. Defining the parameters: Stock price, Strike price, Barrier, Interest rate, Dividend yield, Expiry, Volatility, Number of time steps and simulations
2. Implementing iterations for the Monte Carlo Simulation; simulating stock prices using the Geometric Brownian Motion
3. Calculating the payoffs and option price
4. Plotting the simulated stock prices
